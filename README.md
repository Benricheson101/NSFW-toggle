# NSFW-Toggle
You may have noticed that Discord does not have an option to make NSFW channels on its iOS app. According to a developer, ["Apple requested we remove the NSFW toggle"](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/dcpn5e/). Because of this, iOS users (like myself) have not been able to make NSFW channels for a while.

This bot has one purpose, and one purpose only: to enable or disable NSFW on channels.

**Aliases**: `name-nsfw`, `not-nsfw`, `toggle-nsfw`\
